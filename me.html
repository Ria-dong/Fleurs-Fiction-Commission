  <h1>About me</h1>
  <!-- this is a self intro -->

  <p class="normal">
    My name is Lingran Dong. I am currently majoring in Business Information Systems and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Supply Chain Management. My hobby is writing novels. 
    I fell in love with literature when I was in primary school and have write original and fan fictions since then. In high school, I posted some articles on social media and received dozens of writing commissions. For some reasons, I have been stuck in the bottleneck for a long time, therefore, I temporary turn my goal to build a channel for writers and funders to easily find and connect with each other and ideally provide some legal protection for both sides.
