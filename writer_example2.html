      He dreamt of a perfect finale. The singing and the soaring flags, petals fluttering, flames and cheers, the swirling lace skirts that danced and twirled, and the audience reaching forward, stretching their arms, trying to touch the light and the moon. Sometimes he stood on the stage and looked down, seeing more blurred smiling faces than he had seen in the past ten years. Without origin or blood, their faces were pure and glowing as they appreciated the beauty.
      <br><br>
      Then he woke up, feeling cold sweat trickling down from his temples, the stones around his neck ached from being soaked, as if he had seen something unpleasant. The half-digested dry bread and sweet porridge in his stomach churned, making him nauseous. But the phantom straightened his back, stiffened his neck, and swallowed down the fluids that had risen to his throat again, even though it would make his throat ache all night. The financial situation of the theater troupe was definitely not good, and not everyone was willing to give up their lives for a performance.
      <br><br>
      The phantom was willing to die for a play.
      <br><br>
      There weren't many moments in his life when he wanted to die. Being alive for him was more of a state than a goal. There was a time when a child invited them to jump off the top of the church in the base, and many people went, and many people came back alive, but the phantom looked up at them like a lonely soul under the gaze of the stone angels, empty in body and mind.
      <br><br>
      But in a city where everyone fought desperately to survive, the phantom descended. He stepped on the soil of the cemetery, damp and soft, like stepping on a pound cake with dried cranberries.
      <br><br>
      On the night of the grand finale, he stood on the stage, feeling like a ecstatic elf. The stage was so small, and the audience was so far away, staring at his masked face, but the phantom had to use all his strength to send the notes into their dull ears.
      <br><br>
      He performed a completely different life on stage, but it felt more real than any moment in his own life. The mad love born from ugly control, imprisoning his body like a silkworm cocoon, he grabbed the heroine's wrist, his fingers tangled in the messy lace at her collar, and then opened his arms like a strange bird, urging her to sing. Every line of dialogue was seared into his bare heart, or engraved on his breastbone that would never fade away.
      <br><br>
      The cemetery in the vegetable garden would regularly clean up the bones of the past few years. When they were dug out, the hands and legs had already mixed together, and only the breastbone stood out like a butterfly about to take flight. But before they could fly away, they would be trampled into small pieces by military boots, lying in the soil, mixed into the salty soup boiled from cabbage, becoming someone's muscle or bone.
      His reason was composed of bones, flesh, arteries, and blood splattered on a knife. But it was the songs, scripts, and costumes, along with a fictional passionate love, that made his blood boil. It was his sharp ears, his singing throat, and his soul that could touch beauty that made him a third-rate stage actor.
      <br><br>
      His ears were hurting, and he vaguely heard the sound of thunder striking a mountain a kilometer away, as well as the bubbling hot soup in winter. The handkerchief at the collar on the left side was soaked and dyed crimson when he looked down, as if something had pierced his eardrums, perhaps the originium, or maybe it was because his heart had never been filled with such passionate blood before.
      <br><br>
      He saw Sacazla holding his hand, her mouth moving, but he couldn't hear any sound. The music and his own voice had gone far away from him. The puppet knew he couldn't hear the sound anymore, but the melody and lines were already ingrained in his heart, especially the finale, which he sang repeatedly in his dreams every night.
      <br><br>
      The two cups of honey water forcibly poured down his throat made his voice sticky and painfully sharp. The air around him turned into a gelatinous solid, enveloping his body and voice. The intangible gel blocked all his senses, and his nasal cavity and throat felt like drowning, filled with unknown substances. When he breathed hard, he smelled the scent of graves deep in the earth.
      <br><br>
      Then came the blood, a large amount of blood pouring out from his mouth. The capillaries in his nose also burst, and hot blood and some jelly-like blood clots flowed out from his ears, nose, eyes, and mouth incessantly. Some dripped directly onto the ground, staining his cravat completely red. Cool blood tears welled up in his eye sockets, but they couldn't dilute the crimson that enveloped his eyeballs.
      <br><br>
      He heard the music again, the hastily composed new piece, the imagined instruments and countless rehearsals, leading everyone to sing and dance with raised skirts and tapping heels, aiming straight for the endpoint of the joyous illusion. He also heard his own voice in the tremolo of the violin.
      <br><br>
      Then the puppet felt calm, his heartbeat gradually slowing down, just like they had trained countless times in the pond at the base, 50 beats per minute, or even fewer. His body temperature dropped as the slowly evaporating blood from his skin, making him feel comfortable, without pain or fear, as if soaking in a pool with the same temperature as his body, allowing his soul to easily overflow from his shell.
      <br><br>
      But his heart was still in the world, hanging upside down on this small piece of wood called a stage.
