  <h1>About my site</h1>
  <!-- this is a reflection -->
  <p class="normal">
    I thoroughly enjoy spending time exercising my imagination and creating websites, and I have learned a great deal through practical experience.
    <br> <br>
    First and foremost, the content of a website is of utmost importance. While I have seen numerous examples in design and coursework emphasizing the significance of good color schemes and animations in attracting visitors, I firmly believe that it is the content that keeps people engaged and makes them fall in love with a website. Although I have considered changing the topic to feature bands or tourist attractions to meet specific website design requirements, once I began working on this website, I couldn't bring myself to abandon it. I discovered that I have a greater passion for writing and a desire to contribute to the community. While I initially envisioned incorporating practical payment functionalities similar to eBay, the current state of the website still excites me. If one day it can truly operate as a public website, I believe it will capture the hearts of many.
    <br> <br>
    Secondly, I have acquired a wealth of knowledge in website design techniques and coding. Initially, I enrolled in this course because of an interactive storytelling software called "Inky." To align the software's pages with my preferences, I needed to adjust various parameters. However, at that time, I had no prior experience in web design and even attempted to write CSS within HTML files. Now, I am capable of implementing simple animations using JavaScript and CSS. For instance, in the index, I utilized JavaScript to monitor different behaviors, allowing users to flip pages using either a mouse or swipe gestures on mobile screens. The fade-in effect during page transitions is solely achieved through CSS, resulting in smoother transitions.  </p>
