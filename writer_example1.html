      The Doctor has passed away, but the medical advice remains. They ultimately decided to stay in Victoria, not because the epidemic in the city had improved, but because the refuge they had originally planned to seek had also fallen. The only thing worth celebrating was that the playwright had finally finished revising the script for the finale before the night performance.
      <br><br>
      It was a mediocre and imperfect ending where the villain was not punished, but instead redeemed by the kind-hearted female lead. But contrary to the completely collapsed script, everyone seemed excited. The girls twirled their skirts, sang the last song before the curtain call, and even the Commander, who was usually critical, praised it as a masterpiece worth being recorded in history. Colorful confetti and laser lights were scattered in the air like mist, gently landing on shoulders and hair ends, radiating tiny specks of light.
      <br><br>
      Chimera's pale face also looked much rosier, with a flush on his raised cheekbones. He thanked every voice of praise with trembling lips, straightening his hunched back with creaking sounds, and leaned in to exchange kisses on the cheeks with the girls dancing around him. When he was finally supported back by the apprentice, he was still emitting a shrill cheer, like a strange bird.
      <br><br>
      The chaotic crowd gradually quieted down, looking like cheerful puppet toys with their arms holding their skirts drooping down, and lace edges crumpled into balls in their hands. Even the Shadow didn't know how Chimera's wings grew, so no one could repair his wings. They could only leave more bread for him, but Chimera couldn't even swallow porridge smoothly, choking on it in his throat.
      <br><br>
      When the Shadow looked at him, it was like looking at himself, or rather, looking at his own end. That's how Miner's Lung worked, slowly wearing away life, until flesh and blood turned into inorganic stone. Soon his throat would also become like that, or worse. Drinking a sip of water would cause him to vomit stomach acid, which would erode the mucous membrane in his throat during vomiting, and then he would no longer be able to sing.
      <br><br>
      In his life, there was nothing more important than living and singing, but when he realized that he would lose both at the same time, that feeling of refusing to lose and unwillingness faded a lot. Some countries euthanize terminal Miner's Lung patients, but Victoria obviously has not reached that level of civilization, nor that level of barbarism. But every night after performing on stage, unable to fall asleep, he felt a sense of tranquility that comes from being in control of the passing of life, like facing death head-on as a suicide.
      <br><br>
      He heard the news of Chimera's death on the next morning, amidst the sounds of mournful crying.
      Serene, quiet, with the scent of wild flowers. Soon he would be submerged in the soil, just like the souls of the departed, as the earth lifted by shovels filled his mouth and nose, drowning him beneath the land where he had once danced.
      <br><br>
      He poured a cup of honey water for the weeping girl, and another for himself, sipping it slowly. The undissolved syrup made his esophagus sticky, but he didn't dare tell anyone, fearing that his voice would become unbearable without first drinking some warm water.
      <br><br>
      "We should go for rehearsal," said Saccas, "for the living and the dead."
      <br><br>
      "For everyone," he replied, lifting the cover of the piano, "from the moment we first met, shall we?"
