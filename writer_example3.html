      I remember the year 1986 when I was teaching in Letania. Letania was a place belonging to exiles, where everything, except for the name, including time, streets, storefronts, schools, and students, all seemed to sway unsteadily, blurring time and place. Apart from remembering the name "Letania," nothing else seemed meaningful.
      <br><br>
      I used to live on a street named after a Saccota missionary, but it quickly changed its name for political and religious reasons. After the governor, whether it be an emperor or a pope, that person was beheaded, it changed to other names, and even now, I can't remember what it should be called, and I always took the wrong bus route.
      <br><br>
      Around February, when the weather was still cold and the snow that hadn't melted yet covered the sidewalks, a male student named Arene joined my geology class. He was about fifteen or sixteen years old, with short, ash-green hair, and he always liked to wear loose tops and tight pants that hugged his calves. He came with his parents because their work was too busy, and he had to handle the withdrawal procedures from the previous school and the enrollment procedures for this one all by himself. I took him out of the principal's office and brought him to the classroom, introducing his name and background to everyone.
      <br><br>
      I said he was from Ratlan, a Saccota person, and he was good at chemistry. He was standing next to me, smiling at the students who deliberately bought their school uniforms a size too big, and he softly said his name was Arene, it was spelled the same as " Arene " in Chemistry. He looked so different, maybe because he was only as tall as my chest, maybe because his clothes were so similar to the popular style in Yan Country, or maybe because of his black and fluorescent-colored backpack.
      <br><br>
      After Arene enrolled, he immediately got his school uniform, which was also a little bigger than it should be. Like all boys, his body was wrapped in it, waiting for the puberty to come, with his pants legs and sleeves rolled up reluctantly, revealing his wrists and ankles coldly from the fabric. But that backpack, with fluorescent green cloth strips dangling from it, he carried it every day, and you could see it from a distance when he took off his hat and saluted at the school gate, and he never confused it with the plain white canvas bags during outdoor classes. Although I didn't pay as much attention as I did at the beginning, Fontaine and his backpack always hovered in front of me. I have to admit that his face stood out among the dirty high school freshmen, and I was happy to give him some guidance on his almost perfect test papers.
      <br><br>
      Arene was different from those silent transfer students, with a bit of a young lord's temperament.
      <br><br>
      I didn't know what temperament a young lord should have, and where in Letania could you find so many young lords. But that arrogant, proud, and always maintaining a certain amount of self-esteem look wouldn't be something that an ordinary family could raise. Therefore, I wasn't surprised when I heard that he was bullied by someone.
